## Hi there 👋

Welcome to **BIQ**, a Proof of Presence protocol and app built for the real world.
We make it seamless (and fun) to verify that “you were there”—no GPS, no QR codes, no friction.
Just BLE, trust, and a little magic.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
